	- RSA – 4096 bit;
	- ECDSA – 384-512 bit;
	- GOST 34.310-2004 – 256 bit.

#### Example ####
```go
const (
    // Library file name
    libName = "libcertex-rcsp_r.so.1"
	// Path to the configuration file
	confPath = "/etc/rcsp.conf"
    // PIN Code of HSM (bad practice, don't do that in production code)
    PIN    = "25032016"
    // Slot identificator
	slotID = 0
)
func init() {
	mod, err = certex.Open(libName, confPath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Open module error: ", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	mod.Lock()
	defer mod.Unlock()

	opts := certex.Options{
		PIN:       PIN,
		ReadWrite: true,
	}
	slot, err = mod.Slot(slotID, opts)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Open slot error: ", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
    info, _ := slot.GetSlotInfo()
    fmt.Printf("Slot Info: %+v\n", info)
